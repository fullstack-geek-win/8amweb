    <p>Enterprise (commonly called as business and used interchangeably) and society as brother and sister have been
        coeval since time immemorial. Both have been inter-related and inter-dependent in one way or other. Only the
        nature of interdependence between the two has, perhaps, changed over the period. Both depend on each other’s
        support and cooperation. One cannot survive without the coexistence of and cooperation from the other.</p>

    <p>There is no single definition of CSR universally accepted worldwide. Different people and organizations have
        defined CSR differently. Keith Davis (Davis 1960) defined social responsibility of business as: “The
        businessman’s decisions and actions taken for reasons at least partially beyond the firm’s direct economic or
        technical interest.

        In brief, corporate social responsibility means business’s responsiveness to the social causes of a given point
        of time.” Nonetheless, CSR is often described as a voluntary responsibility above and beyond the demands of
        national legislation and which encompasses issues such as human rights, environmental responsibility, and civic
        freedoms.

        One way of defining CSR is to look at the sustainable development of society as its starting point. This means
        let the business undertake efforts to unify economic, social, and environmental development.These efforts
        encompass every section of society.</p>
