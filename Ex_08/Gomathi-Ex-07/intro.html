    <h2>Village Dhabha</h2>
    <p>dhabas serve delicious foods both outside and in air-conditioned cabins. Today many restaurants giving homage to
        dhaba culture have emerged. They look like an urban replication of a dhaba with workers in traditional uniforms.
        These restaurants have researched the recipes of age-old dhabas and are trying their best to offer the same
        taste that these roadside eateries offer. These restaurants have helped the dhaba culture gain a status of a
        representation of old India. However, these were affected badly in the recent pandemic. The severity was such
        that the time of pandemic for Indian dhabas was often compared to the time of partition. Even the most
        established dhabas like hundreds on GT road were hard hit during the covid crisis. But, Indian dhaba culture has
        stayed strong in challenging times with its tendency to emerge and establish itself again.</p>
