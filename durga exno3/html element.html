    <q>No Practice Makes AMan Perfect In Everything</q>
    <blockquote>There was a boy, living in a village in India. Though he was a hard-working student, he was poor in math. However attentively he listens to the teacher he just couldn’t understand the subject. Everyone, including the teachers, could not improve him, despite their genuine intentions. However, his grandfather, who had also been a teacher in older days, had a plan. The old man was confident that he would be able to make the boy do well, even in the subject that he fears the most – Math.

The old man asked the boy for just one hour every day, not a minute more, not a minute less. In that one hour, the grandfather taught the boy math. But they were much disciplined in following their routine. Come what may, there never missed their session, and continued the same way for months.

Then the exams came. The boy was confused about what to revise as every chapter seems so well versed, thanks to his regular practices. Everyone was surprised when the boy scored the highest marks in math, not only in class but also in the school. When asked about the secret of his success, the boy told that he credits his success to his grandfather. He also told that at the beginning of their everyday math practices his grandfather had told him – ‘Practice makes a man perfect’.
